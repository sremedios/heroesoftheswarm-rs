# Heroes of the Swarm
## TODO:
### Backend
* Decide on bounds for the game
* More formation work on offsets could be better
* limit fire rate inside the swarm object
### Frontend
* Positions are absolute right now and the bounding isn't implemented
* Render stuff
* following the player
* rendering colors
* text on players
